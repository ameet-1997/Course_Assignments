class A extends A - Typeerror and not Symbol not found
No duplicate class definitions
No function overloading possible
Check if cycles exist in class inheritance
In assignment statements l value can be a base type and r value can be a derived type
Variable defined in function local scope should not clash with argument of the function
In function overriding, the function parameters have to exactly match the parameters of parent function, but return type can be a derived class
Function name and field name should not be the same (Add in the first file)
	Add a recursive way of seeing if symbol already exists in the table
	Check in all_tables if the identifier exists
	Check all functions of inherited classes

No two argument names in functions should match
Identifier in function should not have same name as an argument
Check if return type inside the function body matched the declared return type
Function calls with this parent working
